# socialMenu
A menu for starters thinking about what kind of social organization would suit them best.

Technical steps:
* Decide on a (quick) experiment.
* Based on the experiment, decide on a structured representation of "collective entity". This might be a graph, a vector space, a category, or an operad.
* Run the experiment.
* Revise the representation.
* Repeat.

Experiments
* Crowdsourcing: allow users to run comparisons between a stock of collective entities, to add new types of entities (allowable under the representation). The UI should probably be some sort of spreadsheet, e.g. Google Sheet. So, basically: create a Google Sheet and tack it onto a Google Form, with some custom code wrapped in. Note that this practically forces a vector representation.

Is there some general system for wiki-style contribution to and visualization of relational data (i.e. to a database)?

To do: ask around, perhaps in poli-sci or econ circles, about whether such a list/menu/database exists?
